Got it 👍
I’ve read the **entire PDF** carefully. Below is a **clear, page-by-page breakdown of exactly what the client wants changed / enforced**, written in simple, actionable terms so you know **what to do on which page**.
Everything below comes directly from the client document 

---

## 1. GLOBAL / SITE-WIDE CHANGES (Very Important)

These apply to **every page**:

### Branding & Assets

* Use **ONLY the official MK Fraud Insights logo**
* **Full horizontal logo** must be used in:

  * Header
  * Footer
  * About page
* **No recolouring, no animation, no stretching**
* Keep clear spacing around logo
* Prefer **PNG (transparent)**

### Language & Tone

* Professional, advisory, grounded
* **South African / UK spelling only**

  * organisations
  * programmes
  * behaviour
* ❌ No sales hype
* ❌ No SaaS / startup metrics
* ❌ No “industry-leading”, “best-in-class” type language

---

## 2. HOME PAGE — Required Changes

### Hero Section

**Text must be exactly:**

* Headline:
  **Fraud is not only a banking problem.**
* Sub-text:
  We help non-financial organisations identify, understand, and reduce fraud risk across operations, digital channels, and frontline environments.
* Primary CTA:
  **Book a Fraud Readiness Call**
* Secondary CTA:
  **Download Fraud Readiness Checklist**

---

### Core Problem Section

* Replace stats with **narrative cards**
* Section title:
  **Fraud is already embedded in your operating model**

**Three cards (exact meaning):**

1. Hidden Loss
   Fraud hides in noise, small exceptions, workarounds
2. Misaligned Controls
   Controls built for audit, not prevention
3. People Are the Gap
   Unclear roles → staff become part of exposure

---

### Services Overview (Home)

* Keep **4 services only**
* ❌ No numbers, no metrics
* Intro text must say:

  * Move from reactive response → structured, practical fraud risk management

---

### Process Section (Mandatory)

3 steps only:

1. **Assess**
2. **Design**
3. **Embed**

Each step should be short and practical.

---

### Lead Magnet Section (Mandatory & Functional)

* Must include:

  * Name + Email form
